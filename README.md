## About

Achieving state-of-the-art thermal face recognition accuracy with a very simple algorithm using Inception Resnet V1 (pretrained with vggface2) and Eigenface (less than 500 lines of code including optional training script).

Baseline: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02514.pdf

## Running

1. ```git clone https://github.com/zachzhu2016/thermal-face-recognition.git```
2. ```(optional) python3 -m venv thermal-face-recognition && source thermal-face-recognition/bin/activate```
3. ```cd thermal-face-recognition```
4. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
5. ```python3 main.py``` (any python3.x except python3.9)

The first run would take about 5 - 7 mintues because it has preprocess all the raw face images. During the first run, face images are detected, cropped, and encoded into a 512 dimension array. The following runs would run within seconds given that preprocessed face images had been cached automatically.
